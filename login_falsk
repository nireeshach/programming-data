user authentication and passwords

we are going to use hash functions

we are going to use two libraries

pip install flask-bcrypt

bcrypt = Bcrypt
hased_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password=password)
check = bcrypt.check_password_hash(hased_password,'admin123') => it wil check the password given with the original password



pip install Werkzeug
